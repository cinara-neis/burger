## Brief Description

Eat a Burger is a simple food log application that allows a user to keep a running tally of burgers they have either devoured or not devoured.  A user is presented an area titled "Add a Burger", where they enter a new burger name and either select "Devoured" (they have eaten the burger before) or not devoured (they have yet to eat the burger). If a user has yet to eat the burger it is then added to the "Burgers Not Devoured" area and the name is displayed with a button that says "Devour!" next to it.  When the user clicks the "Devour!" button the burger is then added to the "Burgers Devoured" area where the burger name is now displayed with an "Eject" button next to it.  If the user has devoured too many burgers they can then select the "Eject" button and the burger will be removed from the "Burgers Devoured" area.  Conversely, when a user selects "Devoured" when adding a new burger, it will be displayed in the "Burgers Devoured" area.


This a responsive fullstack application that utilizes a Node.js backend using a RESTful API built with Express and a CRUD implemented MySQL database. The RESTful API makes requests to MySQL database and depending on the CRUD model a user is then rendered a Handlebars HTML template.

## Local Installation

 After a user clones the repository, they will need to install the NPM packages associated with the application by running `npm install`. The user will then need to duplicate the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files in their MySQL GUI to create the `burgers_db` database.

Finally, a user can launch the application by running `node server.js` in their terminal, and access the application at ```http://localhost:8080```
